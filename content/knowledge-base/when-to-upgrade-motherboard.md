The primary circuit board of a computer is called a motherboard, sometimes known as a mainboard, mobo, or system board. It offers ports for additional peripherals and houses several essential system parts, including the memory and the central processor unit, processor. A motherboard directs data to hard drives by controlling external data flow through ports like the USB and IDE. Although your motherboard is a crucial part of your system, it sometimes needs to be clarified when you should update it.

Although motherboards are not frequently changed, there comes a moment when updating this vital part is required. Knowing why and **when to upgrade motherboard** is the primary motto behind writing this article. We have added every possible reason, sign, and scenario when it becomes crucial to update this important computer component or at least help you get the most out of your computer. But remember, ensure to check the other components since it also supervises their selections. Let’s uncover the mystery!

## Tips when thinking about upgrading motherboard

If you are having any of the following problems, an update may be necessary:

1. If your computer keeps turning down or starting up at odd times, your motherboard or power supply may fail.
2. If the fans on your computer are spinning faster than usual or creating odd noises, there are chances that these need to be installed correctly—you don’t have to upgrade your motherboard.
3. If your computer doesn't switch on, check if the power button is correctly linked to the motherboard. This is a typical issue with motherboard upgrades.

## When to upgrade motherboard?

Upgrading your computer's motherboard is an important decision. Numerous things, like overheating or worn-out capacitors, might contribute to this. An alternative to buying a brand-new PC that may be less expensive is upgrading your computer's motherboard. It also offers benefits in terms of hardware support, better graphics support, and performance. In addition, not only does it help your computer run faster and smoother, but it can also improve the overall performance of your computer. 

Moreover, an up-to-date computer is essential for using the latest software, playing the newest games, and staying productive. Most of the time, when you upgrade your CPU, you also need to upgrade your motherboard. If your motherboard is broken or malfunctioning, or if you need to upgrade to a CPU incompatible with that motherboard, you must replace it. There is no need to update your motherboard or CPU if you are satisfied with them unless you are experiencing problems. Let’s uncover more reasons and signs when upgrading the motherboard is beneficial!

### 1. Motherboard is broken

The broken motherboard won’t operate properly, so you need to update it to a new one. The machine can boot up but end up shutting down. The "blue screens of death" or more frequent Windows issues are signs of a damaged motherboard. Unconnected gadgets that had previously appropriately operated or the computer itself may suddenly stop working for no apparent cause.

### 2. When upgrading processor

As processor technology advances, you should upgrade to a newer and faster CPU. Upgrading your motherboard is the only way to ensure that the new CPU will be compatible with your current system. It's crucial to ensure that the motherboard you purchase is compatible with the latest processor you intend to install. The same goes for any other type of processor upgrade.

### 3. Lack of sufficient RAM slots

Each software you run needs a specific quantity of RAM to function effectively. Too many open applications strain your RAM, leaving less and less for each program. Games can slow down your system when the RAM fills up, and the computer strives to keep up since they are memory consumers. If there is no option to expand the RAM, you should replace the motherboard with a better one.

### 4. Expand your storage

If you want to increase your computer's capabilities, upgrading your motherboard may be the perfect solution. Many newer motherboards come with limited storage facilities, and you can’t increase the storage size by any means. Some motherboards have features that enable you to add an external drive to your system, such as a USB 3.1 port. If your mobo lacks this facility, you may need to purchase a new motherboard.

### 5. Insufficient PCIe slots

If the card isn't working, disconnect it and insert another PCIe card into the same slot. The PCIe slot will likely be at fault if the issue continues and the second PCIe card ALSO does not function. In such a case, upgrading your motherboard can give you better PCIe connectivity so you can utilise more expansion options with more PCIe connectors.

These pathways allow your other components to connect and communicate with the motherboard. Having more lanes available allows for more components to be connected at once. If you're looking to add more features to your computer or use higher-end components, investing in a new motherboard with more PCI Express lanes can provide an exponential performance increase.

### 6. No SLI support

The most frequent causes are driver, SLI bridge, GPU, motherboard, and PSU issues. If the motherboard doesn’t support SLI, you may need to upgrade it. But first, ensure whether your motherboard supports SLI; if it does, it should say so under the features. Check your motherboard's PCI-E slot setup twice and make sure the cards are in the correct slots.

### 7. Lacking the I/O you desire

What if there aren’t enough USB ports or other connectors on your older motherboards? Well, you may need a new motherboard with all the desired connectivity options. Moreover, if the connections aren't [working on motherboard](https://pcideaz.com/motherboards/how-motherboard-works/) correctly or the ports are broken. In this case, you need to upgrade the motherboard.

### 8. Want better overclocking

You'll be able to take advantage of the newest technologies that allow for more robust overclocking. Overclocking is running a CPU or GPU at higher speeds than initially designed. With the correct settings, you can squeeze out even more performance from your processor without sacrificing stability.

## How to upgrade the motherboard?

When updating your motherboard, you must follow these fundamental steps:

* **Step 1: Uninstall the drivers**: Remove every driver for the motherboard you currently have. This contains the drivers for your sound and graphic cards, among others.
* **Step 2: Backup your data**: Create a backup of your present system's critical data. Personal papers, settings, and other items are included.
* **Step 3: Remove the peripherals**: Unplug every extra device from your present system. Your keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc., are all included in this.
* **Step 4: Install the motherboard**: Now, it’s time to install the new motherboard. Carefully place it in its place and set the screws in their correct positions.
* **Step 5: Connect the system's peripherals**: After installing the motherboard, it’s time to connect all the peripherals you just removed earlier in step 3.
* **Step 6: Restore the system to its default settings**: Restore the system with all necessary data. Transfer your backup data and setting to your computer.

## Conclusion

Suppose you want to know when a computer user should upgrade the motherboard. Well, it depends upon some factors. If your motherboard is over five years old, it might be time for an upgrade. If you want to take advantage of the latest technology, it might be time to upgrade your motherboard. There are also several other reasons that we discussed in this post. Suppose there are lesser PCIe slots, USB ports, insufficient RAM, storage, and overclocking. In all these cases, you may need to upgrade the motherboard.
