  - answer: No, a GPU does not require a backplate since it can work without it. A
      GPU backplate is an accessory that enhances its appearance, stability, and
      performance and protects delicate components. Therefore, it’s suggested to
      have a backplate on the graphics card.
    question: Does a GPU require a backplate?
  - answer: "A graphics card's surface area exceeds the available space in a CPU, so
      it needs a backplate. A backplate serves three purposes: stability,
      cooling, and aesthetics. Graphics cards can grow larger than anticipated,
      subjecting them to external damage."
    question: Why does a GPU need a backplate?
  - answer: Yes, you can use a backplate to improve heat dissipation, but it is not
      the end-all-be-all. Graphics cards perform extensive tasks; they have to
      accept binary data from the CPU, process it, and translate it into the
      necessary images. Most GPUs have a specialized cooling system to help
      prevent this.
    question: Can a GPU backplate improve cooling?
  - answer: >-
      If you are looking to add a backplate to your case, there are a few things
      you need to consider:
