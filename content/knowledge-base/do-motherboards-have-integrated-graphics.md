No, modern motherboards don’t have integrated graphics. Instead, integrated graphics or an onboard graphics processing unit (GPU) is built into the CPU to provide basic graphics capabilities. These built-in graphics are suitable for everyday computing tasks such as web browsing, email, and office applications.

Integrated graphics is important because it provides an affordable and convenient solution for basic visual display needs. But, it is important to note that integrated graphics typically have limited performance compared to dedicated graphics cards and may not be suitable for demanding games or graphic-intensive tasks.

> ## Key Takeaways

* Modern motherboards do not have integrated graphics, but integrated graphics or an onboard GPU is built into the CPU for basic graphics capabilities.
* Integrated graphics provide an affordable and convenient solution for basic visual display needs, but have limited performance compared to dedicated graphics cards.
* These offer cost savings, space savings, and energy efficiency, but may not be suitable for demanding applications and may have lower memory and bandwidth.

## Availability of Integrated Graphics on Motherboards

Although most modern motherboards don’t have integrated graphics, a few older ones have onboard graphics. For example, ASRock 985-GS3 FX is one such motherboard from the AM3+ socket family that features AMD Radeon HD 4200 graphics.

The availability of integrated graphics on motherboards depends on the specific model and chipset of the motherboard. Some motherboards have integrated graphics capabilities built into the chipset, while others require a separate graphics card to be installed. 

## What is the Importance of Integrated Graphics?

Integrated graphics are important for showing video output and enabling DVI, VGA, and HDMI ports. They provide basic graphics processing capabilities to display images and videos on a computer monitor or television.

Without integrated graphics, a computer would require a dedicated graphics card to display video output, which can be expensive and may not be necessary for users who only need basic graphics capabilities.

## Advantages of Integrated Graphics

The following are the advantages of having integrated graphics.

* **Cost savings:** Since the GPU is integrated into the motherboard, purchasing a separate graphics card is unnecessary, making the build more cost-effective.
* **Space savings:** The lack of a separate graphics card can save space in the computer case, allowing for a smaller and more compact build.
* **Energy efficiency:** Integrated graphics consume less power than a separate graphics card, reducing energy consumption and lower power bills.
* **Suitable for basic tasks:** For basic tasks such as browsing the web, working with text, or watching videos, integrated graphics can provide sufficient performance without needing a separate graphics card.

## Limitations of integrated graphics

In general, integrated graphics should be considered for basic tasks and applications, while dedicated graphics cards should be used for more demanding tasks that require higher performance. Here are some limitations of integrated graphics.

* One of the main limitations of integrated graphics is that they may not be suitable for demanding applications such as gaming, video editing, and 3D rendering. 
* Integrated graphics can provide sufficient performance for basic tasks, but their performance may not be sufficient for more demanding tasks requiring higher graphics processing.
* These graphics often have lower memory and bandwidth than dedicated graphics cards, limiting their performance.
* These may not have the same level of support for advanced features and technologies as dedicated graphics cards, such as support for VR, multiple monitors, and high refresh rates.
