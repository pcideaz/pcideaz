Even a single wrong move could harm the device and make it useless in the future since motherboards are delicate. Moreover, you should also know whether it’s just a regular motherboard cleaning or you have to remove heavy bulks of dust from the motherboard and its components. If the motherboard doesn’t have much dust, it only needs routine cleaning.

In contrast, only a few motherboards need a deep cleaning if they haven’t been cleaned for years. For more information, **deep cleaning** and **routine cleaning** are the two main approaches to motherboard cleaning. Alcohol and great caution are necessary for deep cleaning. This cleaning is required when the motherboard has been introduced to a dirty environment or has had something thrown on it. If done incorrectly, you risk damaging the motherboard. You should include routine cleaning in your regular computer maintenance program.

You don't need to take your computer's motherboard out of the case or use a lot of specialized equipment. Most people just need to clean their motherboards in this way. Ensure the device has no power in it before using any liquid cleansers. This is essential to avoid harm to the motherboard and secure your safety. Remember that putting any liquids on the motherboard will likely destroy any remaining manufacturer's warranties.

Let’s learn more about both motherboard cleaning methods!

### Method 1: Routine Cleaning

In a **routine cleaning**, use compressed air and a very soft brush to give your motherboard a regular cleaning. Turn off your computer and the power supply, and unplug it from the wall before you begin. Since dust will blow out of the computer, you should place it in a simple, clean space.

* **Step 1**: Open the computer's **side panel**; remove each panel if there are more. This gives the required room so that the dust may leave the machine.


* **Step 2**: Use **compressed spraying air** on the machine's parts to remove most dust from the motherboard and its components.

> **Note**: Your starting point will change depending on how your machine is set up. Since dust will fall and collect on lower components as you move down, it is better to start at the top and work your way down.

* **Step 3**: **Carefully reach** your motherboard from the back of the casing to the front. Keep using compressed air on the motherboard until all loose dust has been removed.

> **Note**: You don't want your motherboard to come into direct contact with the compressed air can’s tip. Therefore, maintain a 1-inch distance between it and the motherboard.

* **Step 4**: Keep blowing the compressed air into the **case** and **onto the motherboard parts** once the excess dust has been removed.

> **Note**: Check the motherboard to determine if there is any remaining dust on it. It can be challenging to reach some places, or there might be dust that has gotten caught there that you wish to get rid of.

* **Step 5**: Use the **soft brush** to gently remove any dust stuck on the motherboard.

> **Note**: To get rid of any dust the brush brought up, spray compressed air once again across the computer and all of its parts, including the motherboard.

* **Step 6**: Assemble everything, plug in the power connectors, and turn on your computer.

It's a good idea to perform additional computer maintenance while cleaning your motherboard. The case fans may be taken off, cleaned, and dried. You can tidy up any overlapping cables or check your wiring for loose connections. 

### Method 2: Deep Cleaning

A motherboard should only be deep cleaned when it is entirely essential. Like if there is so much dirt on the motherboard that it feels smudged on it. But this method is slightly different from the previous method for routine motherboard cleaning. Before thoroughly cleaning a computer, the motherboard must be removed. Additionally, you shouldn't plug anything else into it. Ensure to avoid cleaning the CPU, cables, or other attached devices and only the motherboard.

Try this if the motherboard is dirty.

* **Step 1**: **Place the motherboard** on the lint-free towel.


* **Step 2**: Identify the **dirty areas** on the motherboard. This step is necessary since you shouldn't have to wet the entire motherboard to clean it if only a little portion is unclean.


* **Step 3**: Wet the lint-free cotton pad with isopropyl alcohol and gently rub it on the motherboard's dirty areas. Keep **repeating this method** until the dirt is entirely removed.

> **Note**: you can also use dry cotton swabs to soak the extra isopropyl alcohol from the motherboard if you have put too much.

* **Step 4**: Let your **motherboard dry** for at least 12 hours. Once the board is dry, **install it** back into the computer. 

## How often should I clean my motherboard?

Suppose you have placed your computer in a dusty environment may be due to the nature of your work. In such a case, you may have to clean your computer and motherboard every three months. On the flip side, those who work on their computer in an air-conditioned room may need to clean their computer even in six months. 

## What are the advantages of cleaning the motherboard?

There are several benefits of cleaning your computer and motherboard. First, removing the dust opens all the computer holes and reveals the surfaces to enhance the heat dissipation that ultimately prevents it from overheating and improves its performance. Second, your overall system will look good, and you will love to work on it, improving your productivity. Therefore, you must regularly check your motherboard and the inside of your case to see if you need to clean it more often.
