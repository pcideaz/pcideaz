A motherboard, commonly referred to as the main board, is the core hub of the computer's circuitry, enabling connectivity between all the parts and peripherals. Additionally, it enables all components, including the hard drive, graphics card, CPU, and memory, to get electricity from the connected power supply. A motherboard often includes many connections for attaching other components, including USB and audio connectors, and is secured in place with screws.

When you need to verify the motherboard model, things are only sometimes as simple to recognize as computer components, which are easy to identify in your system summary. But the steps may differ depending on your motherboard and operating system when finding what motherboard I have. But fortunately, it's still simple enough for beginners to understand. We've added the simplest methods for Windows, Mac, and Linux to find the board’s details. Let’s discover!

## What motherboard do I have?

Knowing your PC’s motherboard details is essential when testing your hardware or updating some drivers.
