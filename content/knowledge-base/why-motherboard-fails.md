The motherboard performance is so important on a computer that the machine ceases to function if it fails. The motherboard dies when your computer goes down unexpectedly and refuses to restart. So, what is the root reason for the motherboard's failure?

You might take a few precautions to prevent your motherboard from failing, even if a motherboard fails due to age and unanticipated events. It will fail less frequently if you safeguard against some typical reasons for motherboard failure.

> ## Key Takeaways

* A motherboard may fail due to overheating, short circuits, loose connections, improper installation, dust, liquid, physical harm, CMOS battery fault, and normal aging and wear. 
* If a motherboard fails, try cleaning it, inspecting the components, checking the capacitors, and updating the BIOS to restore it to its working state.

## Why Motherboard Fails?

The following are the possible reasons why motherboard fails.

### Overheating

The leading causes of overheating are inadequate cooling systems or fans that are not working correctly, insufficient ventilation in the computer's case, or when the components are placed too close together.

Other causes include dust buildup in the system, inadequate thermal paste, a faulty CPU cooler, or incorrect voltage settings. When the motherboard becomes too hot, it can damage hardware, system crashes, or even a complete failure.

If you suspect your motherboard is overheating, it's important to immediately turn off your computer and check the cooling system to ensure it's running properly.

### Short circuits

If a short circuit occurs, it can cause damage to the components on the motherboard, failing the entire device. Short circuits can also cause heat buildup on the motherboard, damaging the components if left unchecked.

Additionally, short circuits can interfere with the functionality of other components connected to the motherboard, resulting in further system instability. Identifying and repairing short circuits as soon as possible is important to avoid further damage to the motherboard.

### Loose connections

One of the most common causes of motherboard failure is loose connections. This can occur when the motherboard or components have been improperly installed or when components have become loose over time due to wear and tear.

When connections are loose, the motherboard can experience a lack of power, resulting in a complete shutdown or, in some cases, a reboot loop. If left unchecked, this can eventually lead to permanent damage.

### Improper installation

One of the most common causes of motherboard failure is improper installation. This can be caused by several things, such as incorrect hardware compatibility, the wrong type of RAM being installed, not using the right thermal paste, or even simply not connecting cables and plugs properly.

When installing a motherboard, it's essential to know the different hardware components that need to be connected, such as the processor, RAM, video card, and more.

To work correctly, each component must be compatible with the motherboard and all other components. It's also important to ensure you're using the right type of thermal paste and following the manufacturer's instructions for proper installation.

### Dust

Dust and foreign particles might damage your computer's motherboard. Too much dust and dirt inside your computer clogs the heatsink and fans, creating heat buildup. Dust and particles can cause a short circuit and harm the motherboard in rare situations.

### Liquid

Placing water or any other liquid on a motherboard may cause it to fail quickly. Liquids, in general, are partial conductors, and when they enter into a computer's circuit board, they produce a short circuit.

As you know, the motherboard has various sensitive components, and any current going into the wrong terminal, no matter how small, might cause harm.

### Physical Harm

If there is physical damage to the motherboard, it may fail. Many factors, including negligence and inappropriate handling, might contribute to this physical harm.

Assume your laptop falls or something falls by mistake on your laptop or PC. In that situation, a motherboard break might result in short circuits or insufficient circulation.

### CMOS Battery Fault

The CMOS battery is not the most well-known component of any computer, yet it is critical to the motherboard. While the battery is strong and long-lasting, it will only last 5 to 6 years in most situations. If not changed, your computer may malfunction, drivers will be missing, and your machine may not turn on.

### Normal Aging and Wear

Your motherboard may fail due to regular age and use. Your computer motherboard will eventually fail due to its limited lifespan. In most circumstances, though, a motherboard will live for decades. Except for adequate care, you can do nothing to prevent this from happening.

## Possible solutions for motherboard failure

If your motherboard fails, it can be a difficult and costly problem to fix. You can try some potential solutions to help you get your computer back up and running. You can try the following fixes in case the motherboard is not working. 

### Check the Cause of the Problem

1. Disconnect all the components from the motherboard, including the CPU, RAM, and any other components you may have installed.
2. See if the power cable is connected correctly. If it isn't, ensure it is plugged in tightly and securely.
3. Remove and inspect the power supply for any visible damage or broken connections. If there is, then you may need to replace the power supply.
4. Inspect the internal components of the motherboard, such as the CPU and RAM, to ensure they are correctly seated and not damaged.
5. If everything checks out okay, you can then move on to the next step in troubleshooting your motherboard.

### [Clean the Motherboard](https://pcideaz.com/motherboards/how-to-clean-a-motherboard-at-home/)

1. You will need some basic supplies to clean your motherboard.
2. It would help if you began by using a can of compressed air to blow off any loose particles from the board.
3. Make sure to avoid any moving parts and use short bursts of air. Be sure to focus on hard-to-reach areas such as crevices and tight corners.
4. If there are any visible signs of damage, you may need to take the board to a professional for repair - but if not, it should be ready for reassembly.

### Inspect the Components

1. The first step in determining how to fix a motherboard failure is to inspect the components on the motherboard.
2. Inspect the entire board, including connectors, chipsets, and other components. Look for any signs of physical damage, such as broken or bent pins, loose connections, or corrosion.
3. If you find any physical damage, it could cause your motherboard failure and should be repaired or replaced.
4. Check all the capacitors on the board to ensure that none are bulging or leaking. Capacitors can become damaged and need to be replaced to restore your motherboard.

### Update the BIOS

Updating the BIOS is an important part of troubleshooting a motherboard failure. You must download the new version from the manufacturer's website to update the BIOS.

1. Go to the Manufacturer’s official website, select the correct version based on your motherboard's model number and operating system, and download it.
2. Transfer the file to a bootable USB drive to start the process once you have downloaded the BIOS file.
3. Enter the BIOS settings by pressing a specific key during system startup.
4. Navigate to the Update option and select the new BIOS file from your USB drive. The BIOS will then be updated.

> **Note**: It's essential to keep your BIOS up-to-date, as this will help ensure that your hardware is working correctly. Updating your BIOS can fix any issues with your motherboard and prevent future problems.
