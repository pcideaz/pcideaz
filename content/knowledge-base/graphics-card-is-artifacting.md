A GPU can have a visual defect called artifacts. On the screen, it appears as damaged or broken images. Artifacting may also be temporary and resolved by itself. In other cases, though, the GPU may receive actual damage. When watching films or playing 3D games, artifacts are often first observed. The artifacts can sometimes appear in various ways, such as static, flickering, or blocky pictures. Additionally, artifacts may cause the screen to flash or go dark. In extreme circumstances, it might cause the computer to crash. 

"Artifacting" is typically the first sign that a graphics processing unit (GPU) is faulty. The video signal may get damaged if a graphics processing unit (GPU) overheats. This might appear in several ways, such as screen flashing, static, or total video signal loss. Hardware issues like faulty RAM or a bad graphics card can also result in artifacts. Therefore, we’ll look at what to do if the **graphics card is artifacting**, its possible reasons, solutions to overcome the issue, and more in this article. Let’s dive into it and learn!

## What is GPU artifacting? Pictures here

As I mentioned earlier, artifacting is a visual defect caused by the graphics cards. On the screen, it appears as damaged or broken images. We have added some pictures below to grab the idea better. Here is the pictorial representation of the artifacts.

## What are the reasons for graphics card artifacting?

GPU artifacts are often mostly unimportant and are brought on by user settings that push a GPU too far or make it run too hot. Damage and VRAM problems are additional possible attackers that may indicate a failing GPU.

### Overheating

One of the most often noticed reasons for GPU artifacts is overheating. The graphics may slow or break if the GPU becomes too hot. Numerous things, like a buildup of dust on the heat sink, an improper cooling system, or just operating the GPU at too high a temperature, might lead to this. GPU artifacts can upset gamers and possibly damage the GPU permanently. As a result, it's crucial to take precautions against overheating, such as routinely cleaning the heat sink and ensuring enough airflow around the GPU.

### Damaged GPU

Artifacting can most definitely have physical harm to a graphics card as its primary cause. Physical damage, wear and tear from years of playing games at their highest settings, and even the smallest GPU malfunction can result in these problems. Nowadays, most graphics cards come with a cooling system, but for those who don't, you can notice the overheating problem has become a serious issue. Therefore it's worth checking on it sometimes.

### Power supply issues

One of the most frequent problems with artifacting is the power supply. A GPU can experience many issues due to power supply concerns, from small artifacts to overall system failures. Voltage problems happen when the voltage is too low. There are a variety of causes for this, but the power supply frequently needs to support the GPU. You will therefore notice artifacting. The issue of excess voltage also occurs often. This could happen if the GPU's power supply needs to be fixed or set up correctly. In any case, the screen may develop major artifacts as a result.

### Unstable GPU drivers

GPU artifacts are caused mainly by driver problems. Artifacts on the screen are a typical sign that the graphics cards aren't operating properly. These errors appear as flashing dots, lines, or squares in either black or white. Drivers frequently cause GPU artifacts. The graphics card may produce artifacts if there is an issue with the drivers. Ensure your graphics card uses the most recent drivers first to avoid this. They are often downloadable from the business' website. If that doesn't work, try switching to an earlier driver version because sometimes newer drivers cause problems.

### VRAM problem

VRAM-related artifacts most frequently appear as minor color changes on your screen. By removing part of the data that VRAM uses, you can reduce the burden on your GPU if it is determined that VRAM is the cause of the artifacting. The simplest way to cause this harm is to overclock. VRAM-related artifacts most frequently appear as minor color changes on your screen. By eliminating part of the data that VRAM uses, you can reduce the burden on your GPU if it is determined that VRAM is the cause of the artifacting. The simplest way to cause this harm is to overclock.

### Overclocking

Artifacting can result from overclocking since the GPU must sacrifice some of the screens to handle the settings you apply. Avoid being overly greedy and overclocking your PC; your GPU may be able to take an update a few levels higher than what the web instruction suggests.

## How to fix graphics card artifacting?

Let's start with some basics before you purchase GPU repair tools and view all the tutorials on how to enter the GPU and fix it yourself physically.

### Update GPU drivers.

Update your drivers for the simplest solution. The simplest method is to download GeForce Experience and use that to update your system each time you start a new game. You can also do this manually through your settings. By updating your drivers, you maintain your computer ready to handle any load the new, graphically demanding game will put on.

### Maintain a proper temperature.

The temperature rise is the leading cause of GPU artifacts. Consider lowering your graphics card's temperature down to resolve the problem. You can adjust the in-game settings to prevent your GPU from becoming overworked. Adding more fans may also increase flow in your PC case. Think about purchasing a PC case with a roomy design to allow better airflow. Bulky components can produce heat within a PC case, raising the air temperature. Installing aftermarket CPU fans may disperse more heat.

### Try GPU underclocking.

High clock rates on graphics cards might cause artifacts to appear. So, the manufacturer's recommended speed or underclocking of the clock can cure this problem. You may underclock your GPU using the MSI Afterburner program. Once MSI Afterburner is launched, underclocking your GPU is rather easy. You must slide the slider past its initial position to effect the changes. The good news for our viewers is that we have a thorough guide that includes step-by-step instructions on underclocking a GPU using MSI Afterburner.

### Investigate your VRAM situation.

You cannot bring your GPU into a computer shop and request that they fix the VRAM (aside from reducing the amount of data used). You can only do a little if the VRAM is the cause of your problem. They typically advise changing the complete card rather than just the individual chips inside. There are methods to reduce the load; however, if the VRAM is the issue, it's sometimes as simple as changing the card.

### Verify any lost connections.

Your computer's graphics processing unit (GPU) may be loose, which would explain the odd artifacts you see on your screen. All of the connections should be examined and, if necessary, tightened. First, unplug the computer's power supply. Next, unscrew the GPU's mounting bolt and carefully pull it out. Apply a screwdriver to any loose connections to tighten them. After making sure that all connections are secure, reattach the GPU. Activate your computer and connect the power cable to see if the artifacts are still present.

### Change the thermal paste.

If underclocking your graphics card doesn't resolve the artifact problem, your graphics card may need to be adjusted a little more. Try replacing the thermal paste if it does not resolve the issue. The first thermal paste becomes harder over time. Relying on a high-quality thermal paste for your graphics card will help it run cooler. You must take the GPU's fans and heatsink off to apply the new thermal paste.

### Stress tests your system.

When they overheat, GPUs are known to cause artifacts. A stress test, however, can reveal whether your GPU is overheating. After downloading a test-taking program like Furmark or OCCT, click the "stress test" button. Abnormalities will appear on your screen if your GPU is overheating during a stress test. To fix this, use a better cooling technique or add more fans to your GPU.

## Conclusion

Artifacting is a visual defect caused by a graphics processing unit (GPU) that appears on the screen as damaged or broken images. It can be caused by overheating, physical damage to the GPU, power supply issues, unstable GPU drivers, or VRAM problems. Overheating can be caused by a buildup of dust on the heat sink, an improper cooling system, or running the GPU at too high a temperature. Physical damage can be caused by years of playing games at high settings or a small GPU malfunction.

Power supply issues can happen when the voltage is too low or too high. Unstable GPU drivers can cause artifacts on the screen and can be fixed by using the latest drivers or switching to an earlier driver version. VRAM problems can cause minor color changes on the screen and can be caused by overclocking. It is important to take precautions against overheating, check for physical damage, and ensure the power supply and GPU drivers are working properly to prevent and fix artifacts.
