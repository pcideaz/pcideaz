The motherboard is an essential PC component that keeps all of its parts together in one location and enables them to communicate with one another. It allows all computer components to communicate, including the CPU, GPU, and hard drive. In addition, it also supervises the selection of all the elements that connect with it. An effective computer requires a fully operating motherboard since most components won’t function properly without a suitable motherboard.

No doubt, [how a motherboard works](https://pcideaz.com/motherboards/how-motherboard-works/) or how to choose a motherboard is essential to know to better understand the importance of a motherboard. But it’s crucial to understand how motherboard is made when selecting a good-quality motherboard. Suppose you want to understand the motherboard’s manufacturing process or are just an enthusiast interested in exploring more about this component. In this case, this post is perfect for you. Let’s uncover the mobo’s manufacturing process! 

## How motherboard is made?

If the processor is a computer's brain, the motherboard is like a backbone. It offers the crucial communication channels required for the remainder of your computer to function. Like all true workhorses, you hardly even notice it when it performs its job. It still needs more work to manufacture them. Although the features on CPUs are so few that they are invisible to the human eye, the amount of technology used to create a motherboard is no less impressive.

Typically, a motherboard is made of two materials:

1. Fiberglass insulation in layers
2. Copper is used to creating conductive paths

The quantity of technology used in a motherboard's construction is no less significant. A motherboard comprises layers with fiberglass in between that are embedded with copper. Your motherboard would be destroyed if you were to drill through one of the copper lines. Drilling is done to create mounting holes and through holes so that components may be attached and soldered. In other cases, users have had to dig to make room for a brand-new aftermarket cooler.

You're about to learn in-depth about this demanding procedure.

### Making copper-clad laminate

The copper-clad laminate is a fiberglass insulation sheet with copper foil on both sides. The printed circuit board (PCB) generally has a thickness of 1.6mm. Accordingly, the copper foil will be around 0.035mm thick, and the Fibreglass laminates will be 0.35mm thick for a six-layer board.

### Removing undesired copper with an etchant

The copper track pattern on each side of the insulating fiberglass board will connect the circuit's components. A core is the name of this assembly. Because of their layered architecture, there are more than two copper layers to cover on motherboards.

### Constructing a stack

For a six-layer board, double-sided cores are utilized; however, they cannot be placed directly on top of one another since doing so would short the copper tracks on the top of the bottom core. Before being put under pressure and heated to a high temperature, prepreg sheets are added to the top and bottom of the stack.

### Making the holes

It is customary to stack boards together to drill many holes at once, which saves time and money because drilling a PC's motherboard is a labor-intensive and time-consuming operation. Drilling may be time-consuming even when using a high-speed, numerically controlled drilling machine.

### Plating with copper and tin

It would be wasteful to electroplate the entire board because most of the copper would eventually be etched away. Instead, a photo-resist is used, which is then exposed to UV light through artwork and developed, the same as when making the copper-clad laminate. Tin is then electroplated onto the board, which does three things: it resists corrosion, creates a surface that can be soldered to more readily than copper, and keeps the copper from tarnishing.

### Routing, testing, and quality assurance

These are then divided using a numerically controlled router to make any necessary bigger non-plated holes and slots. A "bed-of-nails" tester, an automated procedure that probes both sides of the board, is then used to examine the board.

### Surfaces for attaching

A PCB has SMCs printed on the top surface, then soldered to the board. On the pads where contacts will be connected, solder paste, a combination of solder powder and flux, is printed. The board is heated to 200C in a reflux oven before being soldered there.

### Packing and final testing

Before they are marked as being prepared for packing, every component on a new motherboard must undergo a battery of tests. This is where the motherboard's cables, instructions, I/O shield, driver installer, and everything else are stored. As always, testing is simple to grasp and crucial for quality assurance.

## What are the important components of a motherboard?

You should now have a decent concept of how motherboards are constructed and the components that make them. Additional Components Of A Motherboard And Their Purposes are discussed below.

### Chip ROM

Important data needed to start a computer is kept in ROM, or Read Only Memory. Modifying the contents of ROM is extremely difficult, if not impossible. ROM keeps its contents even when the computer is shut off, unlike RAM, where data is lost when power is interrupted. Because of this, RAM is referred to as "volatile" and ROM as "non-volatile."

### Voltage Regulator Module

A component known as a VRM, sometimes known as a processor power module (PPM), functions very similarly to a computer power supply unit (PSU). The voltage is reduced, a process that takes place numerous times before the energy reaches your home to provide the CPU with the precise voltage required.

### Heatsinks

Heatsinks are typically present on a motherboard near some components directly involved in its performance. For example, chipset, VRM, etc. These heatsinks regulate the temperature by effectively dissipating the heat from the motherboard and its components. A mobo can handle the overclocking of different components without getting affected by the heat. 

## Conclusion

The process of making a motherboard starts with designing the PCB. Numerous other components you might pick depend on it, and some other decisions, like the CPU you'll use in your new PC, also affect the motherboard you can utilize. On the pads where contacts will be connected, solder paste, a combination of solder powder and flux, is printed. Modifying the contents of ROM is extremely difficult, if not impossible. ROM keeps its contents even when the computer is shut off, unlike RAM, where data is lost when power is interrupted. 

Some other components are also embedded in the motherboard are very crucial, like the VRM regulator. This is essential to provide stable input power to the processor. Several other measures are also taken to keep the motherboard's proper shape. This is because it holds several components, allowing the computer system to operate as designed. It offers the crucial communication channels required for the remainder of your computer to function. Like all true workhorses, you hardly even notice it when it performs its job.
