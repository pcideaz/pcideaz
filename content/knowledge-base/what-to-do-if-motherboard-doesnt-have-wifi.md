## Solutions For a Motherboard Without WiFi

Three different methods exist to connect your computer to the internet, even if there is no onboard WiFi on your motherboard. These solutions include adding a wifi card, using a USB wifi adapter, and connecting through a wired Ethernet cable. Read on to learn more about each of these solutions.

### Add a WiFi Card

One of the solutions for a motherboard without wifi is to add a wifi card. This involves purchasing a dedicated wifi card compatible with your system and installing it into your motherboard. Ensuring the card is compatible with your motherboard and any other hardware components is crucial.

**Tips when adding a WiFi card**:

* Once installed, the wifi card can connect to the internet wirelessly.
* When adding a wifi card, it is crucial to consider the desired speed of the connection. Higher-end cards can provide faster speeds, while lower-end cards may provide slower speeds.
* Additionally, it is essential to check whether or not your motherboard has an available slot for the card.

You may need to purchase an expansion card or use another solution if a slot is unavailable.

* Adding a wifi card effectively solves a motherboard without wifi. This solution allows for wireless connection without needing additional adapters or cables. 

### Use a USB WiFi Adapter

One of the simplest and most cost-effective solutions for a motherboard without wifi is to use a USB wifi adapter. These adapters are small devices that connect to an available USB port on your computer and provide a connection to your local wireless network. They come in various sizes and can provide speeds up to 867 Mbps depending on the model.

**Tips when using a USB WiFi Adapter**:

* When shopping for a USB wifi adapter, it's essential to check the specifications of your motherboard to ensure compatibility. For example, some motherboards may require specific USB ports or even a dedicated antenna.
* In addition, you should check the available antennas on the adapter itself and ensure they're compatible with the wireless standard you'll be using (such as 802.11ac).
* Setting up a USB wifi adapter is generally quite simple. After plugging it into your computer. Depending on your operating system, you may need to enter a network password before accessing the internet.
* Using a USB wifi adapter is an excellent solution for those with a motherboard without wifi.

### Connect Ethernet Cable

One of the most reliable and secure solutions for a motherboard without wifi is using an Ethernet cable for a wired connection.

**Tips for connecting an Ethernet cable**:

* An Ethernet cable is a physical connection that can be plugged into your device's Ethernet port, usually located on the back of your motherboard. 
* Once plugged in, this wired connection will allow you to connect to the internet with no extra hardware required.
* Setting up an Ethernet connection is relatively straightforward. 
* First, plug the Ethernet cable into your device's Ethernet port. 
* Next, connect the other end of the cable to the modem or router that provides your internet access.
* Finally, configure your network settings in Windows to enable the connection. This should give you a stable and secure connection to the internet.

## Why a Motherboard Lacks Onboard WiFi?

There are several reasons why your motherboard might not have wifi, and we'll explore four of them in this blog post. We'll look at why older motherboards may not have built-in wifi capabilities, why some high-end motherboards may not include wifi as an option, and why some custom-built PCs may not have wifi enabled.

### Older motherboards

One of the reasons a motherboard may not have wifi is its age. Older motherboards may have little wifi capabilities, as technology has changed significantly in the last few years.

You may need an add-on card or USB adapter to use wifi with your older motherboard. This is generally the most cost-effective option, allowing you to upgrade your hardware without buying a new motherboard.

### High-end motherboards

One of the reasons for a motherboard not having wifi is that some high-end motherboards may not include wifi as an option to keep costs down. This can be especially true for enthusiast-grade motherboards intended for gamers and other tech-savvy users.

Manufacturers of these boards often offer a wide range of features and customization options but can leave out integrated wifi to reduce cost.

### Custom-built PCs

Custom-built PCs are put together by an individual or company rather than buying a pre-assembled unit.

* These can range from basic to extremely advanced machines. Unfortunately, you may need more time if you want wifi on your custom-built PC.
* This is because some builders must enable the wifi when constructing the machine.
* The reason for this varies, but it most commonly involves cost and complexity.
