## Motherboard doesn't detect GPU: Possible Solutions.

The issue will be that the system will not identify your graphics card. For example, you might have purchased a new graphics card, and the system cannot recognize it. Malfunctioning drivers or incorrect BIOS settings might cause the issue. A defective graphics card might also cause it. 

### 1. Examine the Graphics Card Slot

The graphics card slot is sometimes the source of the problem. Your graphics card can be inserted into slots on your motherboard. One of these slots may be damaged, resulting in this problem.

* **Step 1: Remove** your **computer's rear cover**.


* **Step 2: Examine** the **motherboard** and **graphics card slots**. **Turn on** the computer and check whether the graphics card is active, such as if its fan is spinning.


* **Step 3:** If the graphics card fails to power on, the problem might be with the slot, which could be defective or damaged.


* **Step 4:** Turn your **computer off** and [remove the graphics card.](https://pcideaz.com/graphics-cards/cannot-remove-gpu-from-motherboard/) **Place** the graphics card in another slot and see if it works.


* **Step 5:** Try them all if the graphics card still needs to be identified and you have more slots available. There may be numerous defective or malfunctioning slots at times.

### 2. Uninstall and reinstall graphics drivers

[Check your graphics card](https://pcideaz.com/graphics-cards/how-to-check-graphics-card-in-a-computer/) drivers are installed and up to date. If you already have the drivers installed, you should reinstall them (probably a clean install) and see if it fixes the problem. Many problems may be solved by just reinstalling the drivers. As a result, the click control center cannot be launched; check to see whether this resolves your problem.

### 3. Set your graphics card to its default settings

Sometimes a simple solution is to set your graphics card as the default graphics. This option is available to people who can view their graphics card on their Nvidia panel (or other graphics card panels). 

* **Step 1:** Navigate to the **control panel. Right-click** on your **desktop** and choose the **Control Panel.**


* **Step 2:** Select **3D Settings**.


* **Step 3:** From the left pane, select **Manage 3D Settings**. It should be in **3D mode**.


* **Step 4:** Go to the **Program Settings** tab.


* **Step 5**: Choose **the software** you wish to use for your graphics card. You may choose the software from a drop-down menu in Choose software to customize the section.


* **Step 6**: Choose a **High-performance CPU** from the drop-down menu. For this application part, select your desired graphics processor.

> Close the panel and try to start the application with the graphics card set as the default device. You may repeat the preceding procedures for additional key programs if it works properly.

### 4. Examine the power supply

Examine your power supply's power ratings and how much power your graphics card requires. The fact that your [graphics card's fans](https://pcideaz.com/graphics-cards/should-my-gpu-fans-always-be-on/) are spinning does not imply that the power lines are correctly connected. Sometimes the graphic card is only half-powered, which might be causing this issue. You must purchase a separate power source if you require more power than the minimal requirements.

### 5. Update the BIOS Settings

There are a few BIOS options that you may modify. This ensures that incorrect BIOS settings don't cause the problem. The settings that must be modified and the methods required to make such changes are listed below.

* **Step 1: Restart** the system.


* **Step 2:** When your computer restarts, press **Esc, F8, F12, or F10** when your manufacturer's logo displays.


* **Step 3:** You may also determine which button to click by looking at the screen's corner, which displays your manufacturer's emblem. The button varies depending on the manufacturer.


* **Step 4:** You might be in the **BIOS menu** or viewing a list of options. If you see several possibilities, there should be a BIOS menu option among them.


* **Step 5:** Look for a **GPU** or **IGPU Multi Monitors** option. If you have one monitor, ensure this option is turned off.


* **Step 6:** Search for **PCI** and **PCI-E settings**. PCI, Onboard, PCI-e, and onboard backup are all possibilities. 

### 6. Restore BIOS to Default

Many customers have found that resetting the BIOS to its default settings works. Reset your BIOS to factory settings and see if it solves the problem. 

* **Step 1: Restart** the system.


* **Step 2:** You might be in the BIOS menu or viewing a list of options. If you see some possibilities, there should be a BIOS menu option among them. You may browse to that option using the arrow keys and press Enter to access the BIOS menu.


* **Step 3:** Once in the BIOS menu, seek a **Restore to Defaults** or a version of that choice. Again, the selections will vary by manufacturer, but you should have this option. **Check** this **box** and hit **Enter**.

> Once your BIOS has been reset to its default settings, reboot to see whether the problem has been repaired.

### 7. BIOS must be updated

Many people addressed the problem by upgrading their BIOS to the most recent version. Updating your BIOS to the most recent version ensures that your system will work with the most recent hardware. Of course, this post cannot explore several more advantages of changing your BIOS. We've already written in-depth tutorials on how to upgrade your BIOS.

### 8. Uninstall Windows Updates

Several reports of Windows updates have introduced a bug [that causes drivers](https://pcideaz.com/graphics-cards/will-graphics-card-work-without-drivers/) and other software issues. There is a straightforward solution to disable Windows updates. Although this option is only accessible for a limited time, it is worth exploring.

* **Step 1:** **Press** and **hold** the **Windows key**.


* **Step 2:** Choose **Updates & Security**.


* **Step 3:** From the left pane, select **Recovery**.

If [that doesn't work](https://pcideaz.com/graphics-cards/how-graphics-card-work/), try swapping out the ports on the motherboard. If the motherboard is still not detecting the card, it might be time to replace it.
