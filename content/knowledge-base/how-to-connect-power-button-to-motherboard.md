## Tools Required to Connect Power Supply to Motherboard

List of tools and materials required:

* **Phillips head screwdriver:** Used to open the computer case and secure the power button cable.
* **Cable:** The cable is used to connect the power button to the motherboard.
* **Motherboard manual:** The manual provides essential information on the location and configuration of the power button header on the motherboard.

**Note**: The tools and materials required can be purchased at most computer and electronics stores. Checking the specific tools and materials required for your system before purchasing is recommended.

## How to Connect Power Button to Motherboard?

By following the several steps, you can connect the power button to the motherboard:

### 1.  Identify Location of Power Button Header on the Motherboard.

* Refer to the motherboard manual to **locate the power button header** on the motherboard.
* The header is usually labeled "PWR_BTN" or "POWER SW".
* If the manual is unavailable, **look for a small rectangular header** with two or more pins near the edge of the motherboard.

### 2. Access the Header.

* Before accessing the header, **properly discharge any static electricity** from your body.
* **Open the computer case** by removing any screws and **separating the two halves** of the case.
* **Locate the header** on the motherboard and make sure it is accessible.

### 3. Prepare the Header for Connection.

* **Ensure** the **header is clean** and free of debris or dust.
* Ensure that the pins on the header are straight and not bent. Bent pins can make it difficult to connect the power button cable and may cause damage to the motherboard.
* If necessary, straighten any bent pins using a small tool such as a flathead screwdriver.

### 4. Know Correct Wiring Configuration of Power Button.

* The power button cable typically has two wires, one positive and one negative.
* The positive wire is usually marked with a + sign or colored red, while the negative wire is marked with a - sign or colored black.

### 5. Connect the Power Button to the Header.

* **Locate the positive** and **negative wires** on the power button cable.
* **Align the positive wire** with the positive pin on the header, and the **negative wire** with the negative pin.
* **Gently insert the power button cable** into the header, ensuring the wires are properly aligned with the pins.
* **Secure the cable in place** by gently pressing down on the cable until it clicks into place.

### 6. Secure the Connection to Prevent Any Damage or Loose Wires.

* **Check the connection** to ensure the cable is securely in place and the wires are not loose.
* **Use cable or zip ties** to secure the power button cable to the case or motherboard to prevent damage from movement or vibration.
* **Replace the computer case** by screwing it back together and securing it.

### 7. Test the Connection to Ensure it is Working Correctly.

* **Close the computer case** and **plug in all necessary cables**, including the power cable.
* **Press the power button** to turn the system on.
* The connection is working correctly if the system turns on and starts up normally.

### 8. Double-check Everything if Connection is Not Working.

* If the system does not turn on, check the connection between the power button cable and header to ensure it is secure.
* If the connection is secure, check the power button to ensure it is not damaged or defective.
* If the problem persists, refer to the motherboard manual or seek assistance from a professional to diagnose and resolve the issue.
